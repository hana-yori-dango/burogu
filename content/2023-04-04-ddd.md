## Concise definition

Domain Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that emphasizes understanding and modeling the domain of the problem being solved. It involves collaboration between domain experts, software developers, and stakeholders to build software systems that accurately reflect the needs of the business. DDD uses a common language and shared understanding of the domain to facilitate communication, and design patterns and architectural principles to create a maintainable software system.

## Longer definition

Domain Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on understanding and modeling the domain of the problem being solved. It involves breaking down complex business problems into smaller, more manageable components and then building software systems that reflect the structure and behavior of those components.

DDD emphasizes the importance of collaboration between domain experts, software developers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the resulting software system accurately reflects the needs of the business. It also advocates for the use of a common language and shared understanding of the domain to facilitate communication and reduce misunderstandings.

In DDD, the domain is modeled using a set of concepts, entities, and relationships that reflect the real-world domain being modeled. These models are expressed using a ubiquitous language that is shared by all stakeholders and is used to drive the development of the software system.

DDD also places a strong emphasis on the use of design patterns and architectural principles to create a well-structured and maintainable software system. It advocates for the use of domain-driven design patterns such as aggregates, repositories, and factories to create software systems that are flexible, scalable, and maintainable over time.

Overall, DDD is a powerful approach to software development that can help teams build software systems that accurately reflect the needs of the business and are maintainable over the long term.
