## Concise definition

CQRS is an architectural pattern that separates read and write operations into separate models. By optimizing each model for its specific responsibilities, it can improve the performance and scalability of complex systems.

## Longer definition

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern that separates the responsibility of handling read and write operations into separate models. In CQRS, the read model is responsible for handling queries and returning data, while the write model is responsible for handling commands that change the state of the system.

CQRS is often used in complex systems where read and write operations have different performance and scalability requirements. By separating the read and write models, it is possible to optimize each model for its specific responsibilities, resulting in improved performance and scalability.

CQRS can also enable the use of different storage mechanisms for the read and write models, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability in the overall system architecture.

Overall, CQRS is a powerful architectural pattern that can improve the performance and scalability of complex systems by separating the responsibilities of read and write operations.
